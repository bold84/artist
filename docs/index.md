## Introduction

The Artist 2D Canvas Library is an abstraction layer with an API inspired by
the HTML5 canvas API. The library presents a lean API modeled after the [HTML
Canvas 2D Context specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/). The API
is a not-so-thin layer above various 2D platform-specific and cross-platform
2D "backend" graphics libraries, such as [Skia](https://skia.org/) and
[Quartz-2D](https://apple.co/2SljYHw).

The Artist library goes beyond the basic HTML5 canvas API with extensions for
dealing with text layout and mechanisms for text editing, fonts and font
management, path creation and manipulation, and image capture and offscreen
graphics.

Artist is designed with these requirements in mind:

1. It should be open source with a liberal, non-viral license.
2. It should be very easy to build and incorporate in any target application
   or library.
3. It should be allow for HDPI displays.
4. It should have a very lean and easy to use API, using modern C++, with
   standardized behavior across multiple platforms and graphics backend.

## Setup and Installation

The Artist 2D Canvas Library is cross-platform. Artist currently supports
the MacOS, Windows and Linux. Follow the Setup and Installation guide to get
started using the library.
